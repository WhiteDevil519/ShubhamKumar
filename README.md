## 🚀 Projects

## 🔹 SIEM & Honeypot | Microsoft Azure Sentinel Attack Map

### 🎯 Objective
Built a cybersecurity lab to simulate a **honeypot environment** for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing real-world cyberattacks using **Microsoft Azure Sentinel (SIEM)**.

### 🛠️ Implementation Details
- Configured **Azure Virtual Machines**, **Log Analytics Workspace**, and **Azure Sentinel** for centralized log collection and monitoring.
- Deployed a **honeypot VM** to attract malicious traffic and capture attack telemetry.
- Integrated **PowerShell scripts** for log enrichment and attacker geolocation.
- Analyzed security events using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.
- Created an **Attack Map dashboard** to visualize global attack sources in real time.

### ✅ Outcome
- Hands-on experience with **SIEM architecture and log ingestion pipelines**.
- Strong practical exposure to **Azure Sentinel**, **KQL**, and security dashboards.
- Improved understanding of **honeypot configuration**, attacker behavior, and threat visualization.

  
 - 🔹  **Threat Intel Automation**
  Threat Intelligence automation using n8n, BleepingComputer, and urlscan.io.

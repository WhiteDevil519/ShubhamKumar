## 🚀 Projects

## 🔹 SIEM & Honeypot | Microsoft Azure Sentinel Attack Map

### 🎯 Objective
Built a cybersecurity lab to simulate a **honeypot environment** for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing real-world cyberattacks using **Microsoft Azure Sentinel (SIEM)**.

### 🛠️ Implementation Details
- Configured **Azure Virtual Machines**, **Log Analytics Workspace**, and **Azure Sentinel** for centralized log collection and monitoring.
- Deployed a **honeypot VM** to attract malicious traffic and capture attack telemetry.
- Integrated **PowerShell scripts** for log enrichment and attacker geolocation.
- Analyzed security events using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.
- Created an **Attack Map dashboard** to visualize global attack sources in real time.

### ✅ Outcome
- Hands-on experience with **SIEM architecture and log ingestion pipelines**.
- Strong practical exposure to **Azure Sentinel**, **KQL**, and security dashboards.
- Improved understanding of **honeypot configuration**, attacker behavior, and threat visualization.

  

## 🔹 Threat Intelligence Automation | n8n + OSINT

### 🎯 Objective
Built a threat intelligence automation to collect, enrich, and distribute cyber-threat data using **n8n**, **BleepingComputer**, and **urlscan.io**.

### 🛠️ Details
- Self-hosted **n8n** using Docker on Windows for workflow automation.
- Pulled latest cybersecurity news from **BleepingComputer RSS feeds** on a scheduled interval.
- Extracted URLs using JavaScript and scanned them with **urlscan.io**.
- Enriched threat data with **domains, IPs, redirects, and risk indicators**.
- Sent structured threat-intelligence reports via email alerts.

### ✅ Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in **threat intelligence ingestion**, **OSINT enrichment**, and **SOC automation**, while reducing manual investigation effort.
